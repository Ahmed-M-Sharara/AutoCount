# AutoCount
ABOUT: This macro was developed to streamline and enhance the quantification of fluorescent cell images by combining pixel intensity-based segmentation with area thresholding. AutoCount enables efficient batch processing, allowing researchers to analyze hundreds of images quickly and accurately. It provides an optimized approach to distinguish adjacent cell bodies and monolayers, accommodating diverse cell densities and staining protocols. With performance comparable to expert manual counts, AutoCount enhances reproducibility while reducing subjectivity and bias in image analysis. This makes it a reliable, accessible, and practical solution for researchers seeking automated tools for fluorescent cell quantification.

# Installation: 
1. Download the AutoCount.ijm file from the GitHub repository.
2. Move the downloaded file to a location of your choice, such as your computer's "Downloads" folder.
3. Open the ImageJ or FIJI software on your computer.
4. Follow the instructions within ImageJ/FIJI to install the AutoCount.ijm macro.
