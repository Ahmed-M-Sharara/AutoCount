# AutoCount
ABOUT: This macro was developed to streamline and enhance the quantification of fluorescent cell images. AutoCount enables efficient batch processing, allowing the analysis of hundreds of images with consistent accuracy. Its optimization ensures effective distinction of adjacent cell bodies and cell monolayers, accommodating various cell densities andstaining protocols. AutoCount demonstrates performance comparable to expert manual counts, thereby enhancing reproducibility while reducing subjectivity and bias in image quantification. Making it an accessible and practical solution for researchers in need of automated image quantification.

# Installation: 
1. Download the AutoCount.ijm file from the GitHub repository.
2. Move the downloaded file to a location of your choice, such as your computer's "Downloads" folder.
3. Open the ImageJ or FIJI software on your computer.
4. Follow the instructions within ImageJ/FIJI to install the AutoCount.ijm macro.
